# City_Skyline_CSS

In this project, I learned how to build a city skyline by following a FreeCodeCamp course. I gained experience in configuring CSS variables and reusing them effectively whenever needed.
This project is Responsive, you can resize your window to see the background change colors, that changes it from day to night.
